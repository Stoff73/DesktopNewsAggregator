### Swift Package Manager Dependencies
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Additional Technology Choices]
Required third-party packages to add via SPM:
1. **FeedKit** (4.1+): https://github.com/nmdias/FeedKit - RSS/Atom feed parsing
2. **SwiftSoup** (2.6+): https://github.com/scinfu/SwiftSoup - HTML parsing for web scraping
3. **SQLite.swift** (0.14+): https://github.com/stephencelis/SQLite.swift - Type-safe SQLite wrapper

Development dependency:
- **SwiftLint** (0.54+): For code consistency and linting

### Coding Standards Configuration
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Swift Style Guide]

**Naming Conventions**:
- Types and protocols: PascalCase (e.g., `ArticleCard`, `FetchProtocol`)
- Variables and functions: camelCase (e.g., `fetchArticles()`, `currentKeyword`)
- Instance constants: camelCase, Type constants: PascalCase
- Treat acronyms as words (use `urlString` not `URLString`)

**Code Organization Requirements**:
- Use MARK comments to organize file sections:
  - `// MARK: - Properties`
  - `// MARK: - Lifecycle`
  - `// MARK: - Private Methods`
- File structure order: Imports → Protocols → Main Type → Extensions
- Properties order: Public before private
- Use guard statements for early returns
- Prefer async/await over completion handlers

**SwiftLint Rules to Configure**:
```yaml
documentation_comments:
  - warning: Missing documentation for public interfaces
  - exclude: Tests, Views
```

### Build Configuration Details
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
- **Deployment Target**: macOS 11.0 minimum
- **Architectures**: Support both x86_64 (Intel) and arm64 (Apple Silicon)
- **Build Configurations**: Debug and Release
- **Code Signing**: Development team (can be configured later)
- **Swift Language Version**: 5.9+

### Testing Standards

- UI Components: 80% coverage
- Services: 85% coverage
- Utilities: 95% coverage

**Test Patterns to Use**:
- Async test setup with `async throws`
- Performance testing with `measure` blocks
- Mock objects for network dependencies
- In-memory databases for testing
