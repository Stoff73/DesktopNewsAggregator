## Validation Details

**MVP Scope:** The clear separation of MVP (Epics 1-3) from Phase 2/3 features ensures a realistic 2-3 week delivery timeline while still providing core value through the visual intelligence system.

**Technical Readiness:** All technical constraints are clearly defined with Swift/SwiftUI, SQLite, and OpenAI Agents SDK requirements explicit. Risk areas identified include WebKit memory usage and SwiftUI limitations on macOS 11.

**Recommendations:** No blocking issues found. Consider adding basic monitoring requirements for MVP and defining support model for post-MVP phases.

## Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design.
