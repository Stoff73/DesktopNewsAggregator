# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable Mac users to consolidate 10-15 news sources into a single, efficient morning briefing experience
- Reduce daily news consumption time from 45+ minutes to under 15 minutes through visual intelligence
- Provide instant pattern recognition across all sources using color-coded keyword visualization  
- Create a distraction-free reading environment by eliminating ads, comments, and auto-playing content
- Support multiple consumption modes (Focus, Power, Ambient) to accommodate different cognitive styles
- Build foundation for AI agent integration to enable future deep research capabilities

## Background Context

The Desktop News Aggregator addresses the critical inefficiency in how 2.3 million Mac-using professionals consume news daily. Currently, knowledge workers waste 235 hours annually (equivalent to 6 work weeks) switching between an average of 8.3 news sources, with 67% reporting difficulty tracking topics across sources and 34% missing critical industry developments due to fragmentation. Unlike existing aggregators that simply list articles, this solution introduces a proprietary visual intelligence system using color-coded keywords and a card-based UI that enables 3-second topic scanning across all sources simultaneously.

The product is designed as a Mac-native SwiftUI application targeting research analysts, product managers, and executive leaders who need to maintain strategic awareness without time investment. By consolidating fragmented sources, providing visual pattern recognition, and preparing for AI-augmented workflows, the aggregator positions itself not just as a news reader but as an evolving intelligence platform that will provide a 2-year competitive advantage to early adopters by 2026.
