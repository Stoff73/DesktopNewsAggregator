# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The Desktop News Aggregator embraces a "glanceable intelligence" design philosophy where information density is balanced with visual clarity. The interface disappears into the background, letting color-coded patterns become the primary communication layer. Users should feel like they're looking at a living heat map of their information landscape, not reading a traditional list. The experience prioritizes recognition over recallâ€”users learn to "read" the color patterns before reading any text, achieving the promised 3-second topic awareness.

The design follows macOS native patterns while introducing the unique card-based visual system. Every interaction should feel responsive and purposeful, with smooth animations that aid comprehension rather than decorate. The interface adapts to different consumption modes without forcing users into a single workflow.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Color-First Scanning**: Users scan the color patterns across cards before reading any text, with keywords creating a visual rhythm across the interface
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Cards show just enough (headline + 2 lines) to make decisions, with full content one click away
- **Hover-to-Focus**: Hovering over cards slightly enlarges them and reveals additional metadata without clicking
- **Spatial Memory**: Sources always appear in consistent positions, allowing users to develop muscle memory for their favorite sources
- **Zero-Click Intelligence**: The mere act of opening the app provides immediate value through visual patterns, no interaction required
- **Direct Manipulation**: Drag sources to reorder, drag keywords to cards to filter, drag cards to collections (future)

## Core Screens and Views

**Main Dashboard**
- Primary card grid/list view showing all fetched articles
- Visual keyword density indicator bar at top
- Source sidebar (collapsible) for quick filtering
- Keyword legend showing active colors and counts

**Settings Window** 
- Sources tab: Add/remove sources with live preview
- Keywords tab: Color picker with real-time preview on sample text
- Schedule tab: Simple time pickers for fetch times (Phase 2)

**Compact Floating Window** (Phase 2)
- Minimal view for monitoring while working
- Shows just keyword counts and top matches
- Always-on-top option for ambient awareness

**Quick Look Preview**
- Space bar preview of full article without leaving app
- Maintains keyword highlighting in preview
- Swipe or arrow keys to navigate between articles

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The MVP will provide basic accessibility with full WCAG AA compliance planned for Phase 2:
- **MVP**: System color compliance, keyboard navigation basics, high contrast borders
- **Phase 2**: Full VoiceOver support, pattern alternatives for colors, keyboard shortcuts
- **Phase 3**: WCAG AAA compliance with enhanced contrast ratios and full screen reader optimization

## Branding

The application adopts a "neutral canvas" approach, letting the content and keyword colors be the brand. The interface uses:
- System fonts (SF Pro Display/Text) for native feel
- Minimal chrome with translucent materials matching macOS Big Sur+ aesthetic  
- No branded colors except for keyword highlights
- Focus on typography hierarchy and white space
- Subtle shadows and depth to separate content layers

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**MVP Focus**: macOS desktop application (13"-32" displays)
- Responsive layout adapting from single column (13" MacBook) to multi-column (27"+ displays)
- Retina and non-Retina support with resolution-independent rendering
- Native macOS 11+ with SwiftUI where possible, AppKit fallbacks for compatibility

**Future Expansion** (Phase 3+):
- iOS companion app (read-only sync)
- Web version for cross-platform access
- Apple Watch complications for keyword alerts
