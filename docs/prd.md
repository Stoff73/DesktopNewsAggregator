# Desktop News Aggregator Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable Mac users to consolidate 10-15 news sources into a single, efficient morning briefing experience
- Reduce daily news consumption time from 45+ minutes to under 15 minutes through visual intelligence
- Provide instant pattern recognition across all sources using color-coded keyword visualization  
- Create a distraction-free reading environment by eliminating ads, comments, and auto-playing content
- Support multiple consumption modes (Focus, Power, Ambient) to accommodate different cognitive styles
- Build foundation for AI agent integration to enable future deep research capabilities

### Background Context

The Desktop News Aggregator addresses the critical inefficiency in how 2.3 million Mac-using professionals consume news daily. Currently, knowledge workers waste 235 hours annually (equivalent to 6 work weeks) switching between an average of 8.3 news sources, with 67% reporting difficulty tracking topics across sources and 34% missing critical industry developments due to fragmentation. Unlike existing aggregators that simply list articles, this solution introduces a proprietary visual intelligence system using color-coded keywords and a card-based UI that enables 3-second topic scanning across all sources simultaneously.

The product is designed as a Mac-native SwiftUI application targeting research analysts, product managers, and executive leaders who need to maintain strategic awareness without time investment. By consolidating fragmented sources, providing visual pattern recognition, and preparing for AI-augmented workflows, the aggregator positions itself not just as a news reader but as an evolving intelligence platform that will provide a 2-year competitive advantage to early adopters by 2026.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The Desktop News Aggregator embraces a "glanceable intelligence" design philosophy where information density is balanced with visual clarity. The interface disappears into the background, letting color-coded patterns become the primary communication layer. Users should feel like they're looking at a living heat map of their information landscape, not reading a traditional list. The experience prioritizes recognition over recallâ€”users learn to "read" the color patterns before reading any text, achieving the promised 3-second topic awareness.

The design follows macOS native patterns while introducing the unique card-based visual system. Every interaction should feel responsive and purposeful, with smooth animations that aid comprehension rather than decorate. The interface adapts to different consumption modes without forcing users into a single workflow.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Color-First Scanning**: Users scan the color patterns across cards before reading any text, with keywords creating a visual rhythm across the interface
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Cards show just enough (headline + 2 lines) to make decisions, with full content one click away
- **Hover-to-Focus**: Hovering over cards slightly enlarges them and reveals additional metadata without clicking
- **Spatial Memory**: Sources always appear in consistent positions, allowing users to develop muscle memory for their favorite sources
- **Zero-Click Intelligence**: The mere act of opening the app provides immediate value through visual patterns, no interaction required
- **Direct Manipulation**: Drag sources to reorder, drag keywords to cards to filter, drag cards to collections (future)

### Core Screens and Views

**Main Dashboard**
- Primary card grid/list view showing all fetched articles
- Visual keyword density indicator bar at top
- Source sidebar (collapsible) for quick filtering
- Keyword legend showing active colors and counts

**Settings Window** 
- Sources tab: Add/remove sources with live preview
- Keywords tab: Color picker with real-time preview on sample text
- Schedule tab: Simple time pickers for fetch times (Phase 2)

**Compact Floating Window** (Phase 2)
- Minimal view for monitoring while working
- Shows just keyword counts and top matches
- Always-on-top option for ambient awareness

**Quick Look Preview**
- Space bar preview of full article without leaving app
- Maintains keyword highlighting in preview
- Swipe or arrow keys to navigate between articles

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The MVP will provide basic accessibility with full WCAG AA compliance planned for Phase 2:
- **MVP**: System color compliance, keyboard navigation basics, high contrast borders
- **Phase 2**: Full VoiceOver support, pattern alternatives for colors, keyboard shortcuts
- **Phase 3**: WCAG AAA compliance with enhanced contrast ratios and full screen reader optimization

### Branding

The application adopts a "neutral canvas" approach, letting the content and keyword colors be the brand. The interface uses:
- System fonts (SF Pro Display/Text) for native feel
- Minimal chrome with translucent materials matching macOS Big Sur+ aesthetic  
- No branded colors except for keyword highlights
- Focus on typography hierarchy and white space
- Subtle shadows and depth to separate content layers

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**MVP Focus**: macOS desktop application (13"-32" displays)
- Responsive layout adapting from single column (13" MacBook) to multi-column (27"+ displays)
- Retina and non-Retina support with resolution-independent rendering
- Native macOS 11+ with SwiftUI where possible, AppKit fallbacks for compatibility

**Future Expansion** (Phase 3+):
- iOS companion app (read-only sync)
- Web version for cross-platform access
- Apple Watch complications for keyword alerts

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project will use a **Monorepo** structure to maintain all components in a single repository. This simplifies dependency management for a solo developer project and ensures version consistency across the macOS app and future extensions. The repository will follow the structure outlined in the brief:
```
DesktopNewsAggregator/
â”œâ”€â”€ Core/           # Business logic, models, agents
â”œâ”€â”€ UI/             # SwiftUI/AppKit views
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/       # Fetching, parsing, AI
â”œâ”€â”€ Storage/        # SQLite, caching
â””â”€â”€ Utilities/      # Shared helpers
```

### Service Architecture

**MVP Architecture**: **Monolithic** macOS application with modular internal structure
- Single application bundle with clear separation of concerns
- Protocol-oriented design to enable future microservices extraction
- Service layer abstraction for fetch sources (RSS, web scraping, future APIs)
- Local SQLite database for all persistence

**Phase 2 Evolution**: OpenAI Agents SDK integration
- **OpenAI Agents SDK** as the foundation for ALL agent capabilities

### Validation Details

**MVP Scope:** The clear separation of MVP (Epics 1-3) from Phase 2/3 features ensures a realistic 2-3 week delivery timeline while still providing core value through the visual intelligence system.

**Technical Readiness:** All technical constraints are clearly defined with Swift/SwiftUI, SQLite, and OpenAI Agents SDK requirements explicit. Risk areas identified include WebKit memory usage and SwiftUI limitations on macOS 11.

**Recommendations:** No blocking issues found. Consider adding basic monitoring requirements for MVP and defining support model for post-MVP phases.

### Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Please review this Product Requirements Document for the Desktop News Aggregator and create the user experience architecture. Focus on the visual intelligence system with color-coded keywords and card-based interface that enables 3-second pattern recognition. The MVP should deliver a native macOS experience that feels premium while maintaining simplicity.

### Architect Prompt

Please review this Product Requirements Document for the Desktop News Aggregator and create the technical architecture. Use Swift/SwiftUI for macOS 11+, SQLite with FTS5 for storage, and prepare for OpenAI Agents SDK integration in Phase 2. Focus on delivering the MVP (Epics 1-3) within a 2-3 week timeline for a solo developer.
